Besides rating the research question and soundness of methodology over outstanding significance of the results, they can help with antagonizing inadequate statistical power, selective reporting of results, undisclosed analytic flexibility, as well as publication bias. Preregistration works well when a clear hypothesis, primary outcome, and mode of analysis can be formulated. But is it also applicable and useful in discovery research, which develops theories and hypotheses, measurement techniques, and generates evidence that justifies further research? I will argue that only slight modifications are needed to harness the potential of preregistration and make exploratory research more trustworthy and useful.},

Transparency facilitates evaluation of credibility, yet, research practices that can increase transparency, that is, open science practices, do not appear to be widely implemented in longitudinal developmental research. In the current article I discuss three open science practices (pre- and post-registration, Registered Reports, and data management) and the opportunities they bring to facilitate enhanced credibility in longitudinal studies. Drawing on my own experiences of conducting longitudinal developmental research on adolescent mental health, I provide practical examples of how these open science practices can be implemented. Using open science practices in longitudinal research is also accompanied by challenges, and I specifically discuss the issue of evidencing prior knowledge of data in Registered Reports and some potential solutions to this challenge.},

  abstract = {Background: Almost half of all mental health disorders have their onset in adolescence. Large-scale epidemiological studies have identified relevant environmental risk factors for mental health problems. Yet, few have focused on potential mediating inter- and intrapersonal processes in daily life, hampering intervention development. Objectives: To investigate 1) the impact of environmental risk factors on changes in inter- and intrapersonal processes; 2) the impact of altered inter- and intrapersonal processes on the development of (sub)clinical mental health symptoms in adolescents and; 3) the extent to which changes in inter- and intrapersonal processes mediate the association between environmental risk factors and the mental health outcomes in adolescents. Methods: `SIGMA' is an accelerated longitudinal study of adolescents aged 12 to 18 from across Flanders, Belgium. Using self-report questionnaires, experience sampling, an experimental task, and wearables, we are investigating the relationship between environmental risk factors (e.g. trauma, parenting), inter- and intrapersonal processes (e.g. real-life social interaction and interpersonal functioning) and mental health outcomes (e.g. psychopathology, self-harm) over time. Results: N= 1913 adolescents (63\% female) aged 11 \textendash{} 20, from 22 schools, participated. The range of educational trajectories within the sample was broadly representative of the Flemish general adolescent population. Conclusions: Our findings will enable us to answer fundamental questions about inter- and intrapersonal processes involved in the development and maintenance of poor mental health in adolescence. This includes insights regarding the role of daily-life social and cognitive-affective processes, gained by using experience sampling. The accelerated longitudinal design enables rapid insights into developmental and cohort effects.},

  abstract = {A growing interest in understanding complex and dynamic psychological processes as they occur in everyday life has led to an increase in studies using ambulatory assessment techniques, including the experience-sampling method (ESM) and ecological momentary assessment. These methods, however, tend to involve numerous forking paths and researcher degrees of freedom, even beyond those typically encountered with other research methodologies. Although a number of researchers working with ESM techniques are actively engaged in efforts to increase the methodological rigor and transparency of research that uses them, currently there is little routine implementation of open-science practices in ESM research. In this article, we discuss the ways in which ESM research is especially vulnerable to threats to transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. We propose that greater use of study registration, a cornerstone of open science, may address some of these threats to the transparency of ESM research. Registration of ESM research is not without challenges, including model selection, accounting for potential model-convergence issues, and the use of preexisting data sets. As these may prove to be significant barriers for ESM researchers, we also discuss ways of overcoming these challenges and of documenting them in a registration. A further challenge is that current general preregistration templates do not adequately capture the unique features of ESM. We present a registration template for ESM research and also discuss registration of studies using preexisting data.},

A burning question is how to conduct power analyses for different L-APIM variants. In this paper, we introduce an accessible power analysis application, called PowerLAPIM, and provide a hands-on tutorial for conducting simulation-based power analyses for 32 L-APIM variants. With PowerLAPIM, we target the number of dyads needed, but not the number of repeated measurements for both partners (which is often fixed in longitudinal studies). PowerLAPIM allows to study moderation of linear and quadratic actor and partner effects by incorporating time-varying covariates or a categorical dyad-level predictor to test group differences. We also provide the functionality to account for serial dependency in the outcome variable by including autoregressive effects. Building on existing study that can yield estimates and thus plausible values of relevant model parameters, we illustrate how to perform a power analysis for a future study. In this illustration, we also demonstrate how to run a sensitivity analysis, to assess the impact of uncertainty about the model parameters, and of changes in the number of repeated measurements.},

This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes\textemdash a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

The need for proper guidance in this area is especially desirable now that data is increasingly shared publicly. In this tutorial, we present a template specifically designed for the preregistration of secondary data analyses and provide comments and a worked example that may help with using the template effectively.
